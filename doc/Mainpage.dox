  \mainpage Point %Cloud Library 2.0

  The <b>Point %Cloud Libary</b> is an awesome open source library for 3-D point
  cloud processing.  This paragraph says some introductory things about the
  library and what it can be used for.

  \section getting_started Getting started

  One of the first steps in get started with the PCL 2.0 is to get familiar with
  the basic data structures.  The first is the Cloud class.  This is one of the
  most central data structures in PCL.  It is used to represent all of the
  various geometric, color, and feature data related to point cloud processing
  Most of the high-level algorithms in PCL are designed to expect a Cloud as
  input and to return a Cloud as output. [<i>There is WAY more to say, but I'll
  get to that later.  This is just a placeholder...</i>]

  To provide a concrete example...
  \code
    // Think of lots of code examples...
    using namespace pcl2;
    Cloud cloud = loadCloud ("example.pcd");
    FloatMatrix points = cloud["xyz"];
  \endcode

  Also, the Matrix class.  [<i>Say a bunch of stuff about Matrix and its
  subclasses.</i>]

  \li Q: Why isn't this page finished?
  \li A: Because.

  \li Q: How do I do something awesome with PCL?
  \li A: Take a look at the following example:

  \code
    using namespace pcl2;
    Cloud cloud = loadCloud ("example.pcd");
    cloud += doSomethingAwesome (cloud);
    saveCloud ("awesome_result.pcd", cloud);
  \endcode
