 * matrix that appears to contain a row for each index in the provided indices,
 * where the elements in each row of the view correspond to the elements at that
 * row in the source matrix. Note that although a view can be used like a true

 * made to a view's data will also affect the corresponding values in the source
 * matrix and vice versa.
