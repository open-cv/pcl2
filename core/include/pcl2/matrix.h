/** \brief This class defines a shared 2D matrix object and serves as the core
 * matrix data structure in PCL
 *
 * This is the data structure in which all point data is stored (e.g., a point's
 * x,y,z-position, color, 3D surface normal, feature descriptor, etc.).  When
 * representing point data, each row of the matrix will represent a single
 * point, and each column will represent a dimension.  For example, a cloud of N
 * 3-dimensional points, will be stored as an N by 3 Mat.  Such Mats of
 * point data are often labeled with a channel name (e.g., "xyz") and stored in
 * a Cloud object so that multiple channels of data can be associated together.
 *
 * \note This class serves as a pointer to the actual data, so copying this
 * object does not create a unique copy of its data.  The actual implementation
 * (i.e., the data and methods for operating on it) is contained in an internal
 * MatImpl object.  These MatImpl classes should never be used directly.
